Step 1: Securely collecting payment information

1. you must also specify an amount when making a charge request.


¹ØÓÚform£º
checkout »ò stripe.js




Step 2: Creating a charge to complete the payment 

1. Once a token is created, your server-side code makes an API request to create a one-time charge.  
   This request contains the token, currency, amount to charge, and any additional information you may want to pass

// Token is created using Checkout or Elements!
// Get the payment token ID submitted by the form: 

These requests expect the ID of the Token (e.g., tok_KPte7942xySKBKyrBu11yEpf) to be provided as the value of 
the source parameter.?????

On your server, grab the Stripe token in the POST parameters submitted by your form. 
//String token = request.getParameter("stripeToken");
//params.put("source", token);
//Charge charge = Charge.create(params);
